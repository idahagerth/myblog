            Intelligent Script, ... I really appreciate an intelligent script
            and this movie was no disappointment. Sure, it wasn't perfect and it
            wasn't scary at all....

          <h4>29 Oktober 2021</h4>
          <p>
            Strangely boring and sometimes toothless in retrospect, the original
            "Friday the 13th" I'll always have a soft-spot in my heart for the
            "Friday the 13th" franchise.....

            Childhood Nostalgia,I was 9 years old when I first saw this movie on
            HBO with my younger cousin and older brother....it was about 1980.
            It was so creepy....

            Classic horror,The further we go in special effects, the more movies
            show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark
            horrors like this one....

          <p>
            the first post-modern horror film At its heart, Carrie is not a
            'horror film', but a film about horror.

          <h4>3 November 2021</h4>
          <p>
            A monster of a movie I re-watched this film recently and was blown
            away by the absolute suspense it invoked in me. I was stunned at the
            quality and realism of a film made in 1975

          <p>
            The one... the only... The Texas Chainsaw Massacre! Let me begin by
            saying that there are precious few movies that can actually scare
            the crap out of you, and this is one of them.....
